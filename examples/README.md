# LEGO SPIKE Prime Backpack examples
This folder contains examples of SPIKE Prime backpacks for OpenMV, Pyboard, Grove sensors, Breadboard, Universal connector and Microbit backpacks. 

## Pyboard, Grove and Breadboard Backpacks
### On the Pyboard  
1. Copy the LPF2.py code on the Pyboard flash drive 
2. Save the backpack_sendNumbers_Backpack.py (Eg. pyboard_sendNumbers_Backpack.py) as main.py

### On the LEGO SPIKE Prime
1. Run the code in backpack_sendNumbers_SPIKEcode.py (Eg. pyboard_sendNumbers_SPIKEcode.py)

Once you make sure the communication between the backpack and LEGO SPIKE Prime is working after running the sendNumbers program, you can try other examples (eg. grove_Angle_Backpack.py, breadboard_Wifi_Backpack.py, grove_Button_Backpack.py).

## OpenMV camera
### On the OpenMV  
1. Copy the LPF2.py code on the OpenMV flash drive 
2. Save the openMV_sendNumbers_Backpack.py as main.py

### On the LEGO SPIKE Prime
1. Run the code in openMV_sendNumbers_SPIKEcode.py

Once you make sure the communication between the OpenMV backpack and LEGO SPIKE Prime is working after running the sendNumbers program, you can try other examples (eg. openmv_smileDetection_Backpack.py, openmv_QRcode_Backpack.py).

## Microbit
### On the Microbit  
1. Copy the LPF2forMicrobit.py code on the Microbit flash drive 
2. Flash the microbit_sendNumbers_Backpack.py as main.py

### On the LEGO SPIKE Prime
1. Run the code in microbit_sendNumbers_SPIKEcode.py

Once you make sure the communication between the Microbit backpack and LEGO SPIKE Prime is working after running the sendNumbers program, you can try other examples (eg. microbit_buttons_Backpack.py).
