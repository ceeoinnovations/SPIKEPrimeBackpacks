# LEGO SPIKE Prime Backpack examples
This folder contains examples of SPIKE Prime backpacks for OpenMV, Pyboard, Grove sensors, Breadboard, Universal connector and Microbit backpacks. 

## Pyboard, Grove and Breadboard Backpacks
### On the Pyboard  
1. Copy the LPF2.py code on the Pyboard flash drive 
2. Save the backpack_sendNumbers.py (Eg. pyboard_sendNumbers.py) as main.py

### On the LEGO SPIKE Prime
1. Run the code in backpack_sendNumbers_SPIKEcode.py (Eg. pyboard_sendNumbers_SPIKEcode.py)

Once you make sure the communication between the Backpacks and SPIKE Prime is working after running the sendNumbers program, you can try other examples.
